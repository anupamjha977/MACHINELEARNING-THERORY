    "\n",
    " The Bayesian interpretation of probability is a statistical interpretation that considers probability as a measure of uncertainty. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update or revise the probability of an event based on new evidence or information. According to this interpretation, probability is a subjective measure that depends on the available information and the beliefs of the observer."

The accuracy rate of the test is 95% (i.e., the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease is 0.95, and the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease is 0.95). We want to find the probability that a patient has the disease given that the test result is positive.\n",
