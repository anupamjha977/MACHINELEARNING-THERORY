    "1.Provide an example of the concepts of Prior, Posterior, and Likelihood.\n",
    "Prior: Let's say we want to predict whether a certain patient has a particular disease. We know from past data that the prevalence of the disease in the general population is 5%. So, the prior probability of a patient having the disease is 0.05.\n",
    "Likelihood: Suppose we have a symptom that is commonly associated with the disease, such as fever. We have observed that 80% of patients with the disease have a fever. Therefore, the likelihood of a patient having a fever given that they have the disease is 0.8.\n",
    "Posterior: Now, let's say we observe a patient who has a fever. Using Bayes' theorem, we can update our belief about the patient's probability of having the disease. The posterior probability would be calculated as P(disease|fever) = P(feber|disease) * P(disease) / P(fever), where P(feber|disease) = 0.8, P(disease) = 0.05, and P(fever) is the probability of having a fever regardless of having the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.What role does Bayes' theorem play in the concept learning principle?\n",
    "Bayes' theorem plays a central role in the concept learning principle as it provides a way to update our beliefs about a hypothesis or concept based on new evidence or observations. In the context of machine learning, Bayes' theorem is used to estimate the posterior probability of a hypothesis given the observed data, which allows us to make predictions and classify new instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Offer an example of how the Naive Bayes classifier is used in real life.\n",
    "The Naive Bayes classifier is commonly used in text classification tasks, such as spam filtering or sentiment analysis. For example, in spam filtering, the classifier could be trained on a dataset of emails that are labeled as either spam or not spam. It could then use the words and phrases present in a new email to calculate the probability that the email is spam or not. The classifier could also be used in sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment of a piece of text, such as a movie review or social media post.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Can the Naive Bayes classifier be used on continuous numeric data? If so, how can you go about doing it?\n",
    "Yes, the Naive Bayes classifier can be used on continuous numeric data by discretizing the data into categories or bins. One common method for doing this is to use a technique called kernel density estimation to estimate the probability density function of the data, and then discretize the data based on the estimated density. Alternatively, we can use the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier which assumes that the continuous features are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.What are Bayesian Belief Networks, and how do they work? What are their applications? Are they capable of resolving a wide range of issues?\n",
    "Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) are a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph. BBNs work by encoding the joint probability distribution of the variables using the chain rule of probability, which allows us to compute the posterior probability of a variable given its parents. BBNs have many applications, such as decision making, diagnosis, and risk assessment. They are capable of resolving a wide range of issues due to their ability to model complex relationships between variables and handle uncertainty.\n",

    "and a non-intruder is detected with probability P(A = 1|I = 0) = 0.001, an alarm will be triggered,\n",

    "0.00001. What are the chances that an alarm would be triggered when an individual is actually an\n",
    "intruder?\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to compute the posterior probability of an intruder given that the alarm has been triggered. We can use Bayes' theorem to compute this probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(I = 1|A = 1) = P(A = 1|I = 1) * P(I = 1) / P(A = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that P(A = 1|I = 1) = 0.98, P(A = 1|I = 0) = 0.001, and P(I = 1) = 0.00001. To compute P(A = 1), we can use the law of total probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A = 1) = P(A = 1|I = 1) * P(I = 1) + P(A = 1|I = 0) * P(I = 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that P(I = 0) = 1 - P(I = 1) = 0.99999. Substituting these values, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A = 1) = 0.98 * 0.00001 + 0.001 * 0.99999 = 0.00109\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can compute the posterior probability of an intruder given that the alarm has been triggered:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(I = 1|A = 1) = 0.98 * 0.00001 / 0.00109 = 0.00899\n",
    "\n",
    "So the chances that an alarm would be triggered when an individual is actually an intruder are about 0.9%.\n",

    "7.An antibiotic resistance test (random variable T) has 1% false positives (i.e., 1% of those who are not\n",
    "immune to an antibiotic display a positive result in the test) and 5% false negatives (i.e., 1% of\n",
    "those who are not resistant to an antibiotic show a positive result in the test) (i.e. 5 percent of those\n",
    "actually resistant to an antibiotic test negative). Assume that 2% of those who were screened were\n",
    "antibiotic-resistant. Calculate the likelihood that a person who tests positive is actually immune\n",
    "(random variable D).\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let D = 1 if a person is immune to an antibiotic and D = 0 otherwise. Similarly, let T = 1 if a person tests positive for resistance to an antibiotic and T = 0 otherwise. We want to compute the posterior probability of a person being immune given that they test positive:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(D = 1|T = 1) = P(T = 1|D = 1) * P(D = 1) / P(T = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that P(T = 1|D = 1) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 (\n",
    "\n",
    "because if a person is immune, they have a 95% chance of testing positive and a 5% chance of testing negative. We also know that P(T = 1|D = 0) = 0.01, as 1% of those who are not immune will still test positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate P(T = 1), we can use the law of total probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(T = 1) = P(T = 1|D = 1) * P(D = 1) + P(T = 1|D = 0) * P(D = 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that P(D = 1) = 0.02, as 2% of those screened are immune. We can also find P(D = 0) = 0.98. Substituting in the values we know:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(T = 1) = 0.95 * 0.02 + 0.01 * 0.98\n",
    "P(T = 1) = 0.0216\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can substitute all the values we know into the equation for the posterior probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(D = 1|T = 1) = 0.95 * 0.02 / 0.0216\n",
    "P(D = 1|T = 1) = 0.8796 or approximately 88%\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if a person tests positive for antibiotic resistance, there is an 88% likelihood that they are actually immune to the antibiotic.\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of the student solving the exam problem given the type of problem (A, B, or C). Let SA, SB, and SC represent the event that the student solves a problem of type A, B, and C, respectively. Then we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability:\n",

    "P(A|S) = 9/10, P(B|S) = 2/10, P(C|S) = 6/10\n",

    "\n",
    "P(A) = 0.3, P(B) = 0.2, P(C) = 0.5\n",

    "Now we can substitute these values into the formula for each problem type:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(S|A) = (9/10) * (0.3) / (0.64) = 0.421875\n",
    "P(S|B) = (2/10) * (0.2) / (0.64) = 0.03125\n",
    "P(S|C) = (6/10) * (0.5) / (0.64) = 0.46875\n",

    "P(S) = P(S|A) + P(S|B) + P(S|C) = 0.921875\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that the student can solve the exam problem is 0.921875, or approximately 92.2%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the student's solution, what is the likelihood that the problem was of form A?\n",
    "To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem again, but in a slightly different way. Let SA represent the event that the student solves the problem, and A represent the event that the problem is of type A. Then we can write:\n",

    "P(A|S) = P(S|A) * P(A) / P(S)\n",
    "\n",
    "where P(S|A) is the probability of the student solving a problem of type A, which we calculated in part 1, and P(S) is the probability of the student solving any problem, which we calculated as 0.921875. We can substitute the values into the formula: \n",

    "9. A bank installs a CCTV system to track and photograph incoming customers. Despite the constant\n",

    "To calculate the number of customers that come into the bank on a daily basis, we need to first convert the time period from 5 minutes to hours. There are 6 5-minute bins in an hour, so the probability of a customer coming into the bank in an hour is:\n",
